## Scarlet-CLI

### A cli application that calls the Stripe API

The purpose of this was to build a useful tool for my SaaS without having to login to the Stripe dashboard to view basic info!

Current subcommands are `mrr` and `customers`

I intend to update the subcommands along with deep nested subcommands to improve ease of use for SaaS founders in the CLI and their subscription business.
