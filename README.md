## Scarlet-CLI

### A cli app for SaaS founders

The purpose of this was to build a useful tool for my SaaS without having to login to the Stripe dashboard to view basic info like mrr, if a customer exists. Having to verify in the webapp takes too much time.

Current subcommands are `mrr` and `customers`

I intend to update the subcommands along with some deep nested subcommands to improve ease of use for other founders in the CLI and their subscription business.
